🔍 What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to a website, retrieving the HTML content, and parsing that content to extract the desired information — such as product details, news articles, or stock prices.

⚙️ How Web Scraping Works
Send a Request:
A script sends an HTTP request to a web page (GET request).

Receive the Response:
The server responds with HTML content.

Parse the HTML:
Tools like BeautifulSoup or lxml parse the HTML to locate specific data.

Extract and Store Data:
Extracted data is cleaned and saved in formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, or a database.

🧰 Popular Tools & Libraries
🔹 Python-Based Tools:
Requests: To make HTTP requests.

BeautifulSoup: To parse HTML and XML documents.

Scrapy: A full-fledged web scraping and crawling framework.

Selenium: For scraping JavaScript-heavy sites (simulates a browser).

Playwright / Puppeteer: Modern alternatives to Selenium for headless browser automation.

🔹 Other Languages:
Cheerio (Node.js)

Jsoup (Java)

HttpClient & HTMLAgilityPack (.NET)

🛡️ Ethical & Legal Considerations
Check robots.txt: Respect a site’s robots.txt file to see if scraping is allowed.

Avoid scraping login-protected or private content without permission.

Rate limiting & polite scraping: Avoid sending too many requests too quickly — this can overwhelm the server or get you IP-banned.

Don't use scraped data commercially without rights.

🚫 Some sites (like LinkedIn or Facebook) have strict anti-scraping policies and legal protections.

📊 Real-World Use Cases
E-commerce: Price comparison, monitoring competitors, product listing extraction.

Finance: Stock prices, news aggregation, financial reports.

Job Market: Aggregating job postings from portals.

Travel: Scraping flight and hotel prices for deals.

Sentiment Analysis: Extracting reviews or social media content.

Academic Research: Collecting data from online journals, articles, or surveys.

🏗️ Challenges in Web Scraping
Anti-scraping mechanisms: Captchas, dynamic content, IP blocking.

JavaScript rendering: Many modern websites dynamically load data with JavaScript, requiring headless browsers.

Frequent website structure changes: Breaks the scraper, requiring maintenance.

Pagination and infinite scrolling: Needs logic to handle page navigation.
